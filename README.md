# Moldova Open Contracting - Data Challenge

This repo is developed for the data challenge session on the Moldova Open Contracting portal launch. The portal is open source (see [github](https://github.com/egovmd/opencontracting)) and is available at http://opencontracting.date.gov.md/

The repo contains the datasets required for the [challenge](https://github.com/anjesh/moldova-open-contracting-data-challenges/wiki/Data-Challenges). These datasets are available from other sources as well, but also kept here for your ease.
